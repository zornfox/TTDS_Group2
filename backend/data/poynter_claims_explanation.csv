There is no evidence supporting the claim that any observed reduction in the number of flu deaths this season is the result of data manipulation. Instead, the lower level of flu activity observed this season is likely due, in part, to public health measures implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19."

It is false that if a patient suffers adverse events attributable to the vaccine, they will not be able to go to court to sue the company that manufactured it."
48,"The U.S. CDC said that the virus which causes COVID-19 was never airborne; masks are therefore worthless Current epidemiological data indicates that COVID-19 primarily spreads through respiratory droplets that are released when an infected person sneezes, coughs, or talks. Growing evidence suggests that smaller aerosol particles may also play a role in the transmission of COVID-19. Wearing face masks and cloth face coverings are effective measures for reducing the spread of COVID-19 because they reduce the transmission of large respiratory droplets. In contrast, some aerosol particles may leak through the fabric pores and around the mask. To reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection, wearing face masks must be combined with other transmission control measures, such as physical distancing, good hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded and poorly ventilated spaces."

54,"The World Health Organization confirmed that the coronavirus is no more deadly or dangerous than seasonal flu The infection fatality ratio (IFR) indicates the proportion of people who die from a disease among all people infected, including both confirmed cases as well as undetected infections. The claim that COVID-19 is no more dangerous than the flu is based on a misinterpretation of the WHO’s estimate that a maximum of 10% of the global population has been infected by the virus that causes COVID-19. Calculating IFR with the upper bound of the WHO’s estimate and recent infection data underestimates the global COVID-19 IFR, which according to current estimates, is at least ten times higher than that of the flu. In addition to lethality, its global distribution, lack of vaccines or effective treatments, and potential long-term damage to survivors make COVID-19 a more significant danger compared to the flu."

The widespread adoption of public health measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, such as wearing masks and physical distancing, are likely to have contributed in part to the lower flu activity observed this year as compared to previous years. However, scientists have also cautioned that preparing for the flu season is still important, due to the uncertainty posed by the novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the flu season has only just begun at the time of this review’s publication, hence it is premature to conclude that flu cases have indeed decreased compared to last year."

The text does not refer to the mandatory application of a future vaccine; nor does it establish ""legal immunity for laboratories due to side effects"" but rather proposes legal frameworks for potential contractual conflicts between the State and the companies that produce the vaccine. The “confidentiality” of the components of the vaccine does not apply to ANMAT or the Ministry of Health of the Nation, but rather limits the publication of the data after its evaluation and approval."

Scientists use case-control studies, like the one cited in the claim, to evaluate whether a person’s activities, such as wearing face masks or going to restaurants, influence their risk of disease. This study approach is not ideal for detecting the effect of an intervention to reduce the spread of a disease when it is widely used, as is the case with wearing face masks.

Recommendations for wearing a mask and keeping a distance are aimed at preventing the spread of infection from both symptomatic and asymptomatic virus carriers. WHO does not oppose vaccination with Covid-19, although none of the vaccines are yet in use and therefore not mandatory."

Scientific evidence demonstrates that wearing face masks reduces the transmission of viral respiratory infections including COVID-19 and the flu. Face masks do not provide 100% protection from infection, therefore additional protection measures, such as physical distancing and good hand hygiene, are also important to practice. A preventative flu vaccine is another effective measure for protecting against flu infections. Similar to wearing face masks, the flu vaccine does not provide 100% protection. However, the flu vaccine can reduce the severity of illness and in turn the likelihood of flu-related complications and death, even in cases where the vaccine does not prevent an individual from getting the flu."

244,"The pandemic is a global conspiracy and many governments have taken part in it, concluding that the coronavirus does not exist, or that if it did, the strict measures to eradicate it were theatrical and unnecessary. The video relies on ""arguments"" that European governments knew about the Coronavirus since September 2019, although it first appeared in China in December, and in September no one knew about its existence. Such ""arguments"" are not supported by any serious facts. The claims in it can not be substantiated in reality, i.e. the video offers false content."

267,"This text questioned the existence of the coronavirus Sars-COV 2, the causative agent of Covid-19 disease, and says it was the same virus as the causative agent of SARS since 2003, adding that “the only difference is the ‘boss’ today, the Masons and the Illuminati. They have taken their businesses to China and are going to destroy the USA and the EU.” An editorial dealing with the spread of the virus and news around the world since April 2003 about the then outbreak of the SARS-causing coronavirus has been misused, as well as the previous emergence of an increasing number of reported cases of pneumonia worldwide between 1997 and 1999. The thesis is exploited that those cases were the forerunner of SARS and that it was the same cause. This is not true."
268,"Why are we wearing masks for COVID-19 when we don’t wear masks for flu and TB which also kill a lot of people? COVID-19, tuberculosis (TB), and the flu are all respiratory illnesses that spread through the air, hence protective measures recommended for these diseases are similar. However, the three diseases differ in disease prevalence and burden, leading public health officials to devise recommendations specific to each disease. Unlike TB and the flu, there are no effective treatments or vaccines for COVID-19. The number of TB cases in the U.S. is extremely low, and the flu has a lower mortality rate than COVID-19. These factors taken together explain why public health measures for controlling COVID-19 spread are needed in the community, but not implemented in the case of TB and the seasonal flu."

277,"The COVID-19 vaccine would not go through the animal testing stage due to a protest by animal rights advocates. Anthony Fauci has already agreed with the initiative of the animal rights advocates. Some animal rights advocates protested the involvement of animals in the vaccine testing. However, the testing has not been stopped due to this protest: 1. According to Anthony Fauci, as well as protocols of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), animal testing is one of the key stages for approving a vaccine. 2. Some of the coronavirus vaccines have already passed the animal testing stage."

Official COVID-19 death rates have been falsified and the World Health Organization (WHO) exaggerates the virus fatality rates and threats. It is disinformation to say that Italy’s COVID-19 death rates are increased artificially. Remarks by Rashid Buttar, physician from North Carolina, and Robert F Kennedy, anti-vaccine activist, are conspiracy theories; Reports about the study conducted at the University of Bonn, as well as the “antibody test” by Stanford Medicine scientist, John Ioannidis, were strongly criticized by scientists due to invalid evidence, and represent half-truth/manipulation.

The scientist's team submitted to 2 calls from the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Nation for the development of an oral vaccine against COVID-19, but was not selected. However, he is working on a development that is in the preclinical phase.

289,COVID is the name of a population reduction plan Multiple experts debunked the multiple false claims
290,"Genetic evidence within the Spike gene of the SARS-CoV-2 genome suggest that the virus is a product of genetic manipulation Although the exact origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus remains unknown, previous claims that the virus contained artificial elements or that it had been patented were debunked. The virus most likely originated in nature, probably in bats, according to the genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and other animal coronaviruses. Dr. Yan claims to prove that the SARS-COV-2 virus originated in a lab, but a careful analysis of her pre-print actually shows this claim is unsubstantiated."
291,"There is no second wave of COVID-19; this second wave is really just the normal flu/common cold season that happens every year Determining the spread of COVID-19 relies mainly on the detection of confirmed cases. Cases are confirmed using PCR tests which specifically detect the presence of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, and which do not detect viruses that cause the flu and the common cold. Therefore, even though the flu and the common cold can produce symptoms similar to a mild case of COVID-19, cases of the flu and the common cold would not be included in the reported numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases."

The WHO has said that asymptomatic spread of the novel coronavirus is rare, they didn’t say that asymptomatic people cannot spread the viral. They further clarified that there isn’t enough data about the asymptomatic spread of the disease, as more research is required to determine the extent of asymptomatic transmission and the research is ongoing. The viral post is misleading."

296,"The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is involved in the purchase of vaccines to ensure that children in Georgia are subject to mandatory vaccination. The document (COVAX Facility) Chachua claims to have obtained is publicly available. UNICEF does not promote mandatory vaccination, but rather ensures global equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all countries regardless of their incomes. Georgia joined the program upon its own initiative. Thus, any claims that vaccination has been imposed by UNICEF and it is mandatory represent disinformation. Moreover, vaccines will be supplied only after they are proven effective and safe."

301,"Italian virologist Giulio Taro claims that the number of those who died of COVID-19 is significantly lower than reported in the Italian media. Giulio Taro’s statement is a manipulation with numbers. Taro only counts those without other underlying medical conditions as virus-related deaths. As of May 21, only 124 people, out of the 3,032 who died, did not have any underlying medical conditions, with 454 people having only one underlying medical condition, 648 having two, and 1,806 having three underlying medical conditions."

The respiratory disease turned into a pandemic is not the same as the flu, it is not true that only those who suffer from previous pathologies die or that their mortality is 0.6%, but it is between 3% and 4%, according to the WHO. The consumption of chlorine dioxide is not a successful cure against the disease but its intake is dangerous for health and there is no evidence that it has any benefit."

It is an oversimplification to claim that “either masks work or they don’t”, because the underlying assumption is that face masks must work perfectly, and if they do not, then they don’t work at all. On the contrary, the risks of disease exposure and the degree of protection one can achieve from different safety measures lie on a continuum. Even though face masks do not confer 100% protection to the wearer or to others, scientific evidence has demonstrated that face masks reduce the transmission of viral respiratory infections like COVID-19 to some degree. Therefore, it remains important for people to continue to practice physical distancing and proper hand hygiene as the combination of the three measures greatly enhances the effectiveness of any one measure used alone."

493,"The RT-PCR test for the virus that causes COVID-19 detects human DNA on chromosome 8, therefore all tests will give a positive result The reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test is the method of choice for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in samples and is highly specific for the virus. For a PCR test to successfully amplify nucleic acids (DNA or RNA) in a sample, it is necessary for a pair of primers, which are short sequences of single-stranded nucleic acids that recognize and bind to a specific region of the genome, to flank the same target sequence. If only one primer in the pair is able to do so, amplification does not take place and the test produces a negative result.

Due to the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, hundreds of thousands of people have died despite the high survival rate of COVID-19. A vaccine would limit transmissibility and thereby reduce the total number of deaths. Furthermore, by reducing the rate of infection or perhaps simply disease severity, a vaccine could also reduce non-lethal yet potentially permanent conditions, such as damage to the heart, lungs, and other tissues. Finally, a vaccine could slow the propagation of the virus through a population by helping to achieve herd immunity, which protects vulnerable persons such as the elderly and immunocompromised. Vaccines confer a range of important benefits, even for diseases with a high average rate of survival."

1390,"A spike in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. seen in June 2020 is due to increased testing. Detecting more COVID-19 cases alone does not necessarily indicate that the epidemic is worsening, as it could merely result from an expanded testing capacity. A more useful metric for understanding the recent spike in U.S. cases is the proportion of tests with a positive result—called the positivity rate—which takes into account any variations in the total number of tests being performed so that actual epidemiological dynamics can be assessed. During the second half of June 2020, the positivity rate, together with the number of people visiting hospitals due to COVID-19-like illness increased. Taken together, both observations indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic is regaining strength, and that the increase in reported cases is not solely due to increased testing capacity, but due to more infections in the community."

People have died from COVID-19. This is evident from the excess mortality observed in 2020 compared to previous years before the pandemic occurred. Monoclonal antibodies that bind to SARS-CoV-2 have also been discovered and reported in published studies, and pathologists have been using such antibodies, as well as other techniques like in situ hybridization which do not require antibodies, to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in human tissue. Several studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 fulfills Koch's postulates, demonstrating that it is indeed the cause of COVID-19."

Their findings that child deaths have significantly decreased compared to previous years are therefore spurious and premature. The duo also failed to account for other factors which may have contributed to changes in child mortality, such as stay-at-home orders, which would have limited the spread of other infectious diseases besides COVID-19."

False-positive results from COVID-19 antibody testing are behind the COVID-19 cases reported in the U.S. The number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is a combination of both confirmed and probable cases. Confirmed cases are detected by highly specific molecular testing for SARS-CoV-2, whereas probable cases may involve antibody testing in part. It is correct that antibody testing is prone to false-positives, because such tests may also detect antibodies against other coronaviruses besides SARS-CoV-2, such as those that cause the common cold.

According to US law, once a drug has been approved by the FDA for a particular use or disease, it can also be prescribed for other purposes at the doctor's discretion - it is called an off-label prescription. In the case of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, they are already approved to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The authorization for emergency use in hospitals, in practice, meant that the FDA gave a favorable opinion to the use of the substances, considering them promising in the fight against the new coronavirus."
1623,"The number of deaths in Ukraine in 2020 is less than in 2019, so there is no pandemic, and the lockdown was not needed. The number of COVID-19 deaths is growing daily. The pandemic is real, and the lockdown is needed."

1628,"Barack Obama and Dr Anthony Fauci gave a laboratory in Wuhan $3.7 million in 2015 for a ‘bat’ project This photograph shows Barack Obama and Dr Anthony Fauci visiting a lab in Maryland, USA, not in Wuhan. The US government never gave $3.7 million to a lab in Wuhan for a project about bats."
1629,"A video in which the man introduces and dubs another video from an interview with Stefano Montanari in the Byoblu video blog. Montanari calls himself a “nanopathologist” and claims that masks cause us to inhale the carbon dioxide that we expelled by breathing. This supposedly produces hypercapnia (excess carbon dioxide). Wearing a mask does not cause hypoxia or hypercapnia in healthy people, so it is not the origin of diseases such as cancer."

1633,"A video refers to a supposed “NASA anticovid necklace”, a device that theoretically ionizes the air around the head, disinfecting it. There is no evidence that this device serves as protection against COVID-19. Air ionization is used in some environments to improve its quality, but there is no evidence that this collar can disinfect the air of SARS-CoV-2, something that the same companies that distribute it deny, and therefore replace the protection of the mask."
1634,"Bill Gates has said that the COVID-19 vaccine could kill 700,000 people. Gates is not referring to deaths, but to the number of people who could suffer some side effect if vaccinated against COVID-19."

In his presentation, he maintains that the pandemic is ""invented"" and that its purpose is to guarantee worldwide control of people. He also claims that there are cures for COVID-19, which is false since there is no effective specific vaccine or treatment for the disease so far."
1638,"Doctor says on video that prolonged use of masks acidifies the blood. The process, called hypercapnia, actually occurs when a large amount of CO₂ is inhaled, but, according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health and a specialist who talked to Aos Fatos, this wouldn't happen with the masks recommended today, as they have pores that allow gas exchange in breathing."

1641,"COVID-19 cases are “up only because of our big number testing” in the United States. If increased testing were the only reason for a surge in new cases, the percentage of positive tests should be dropping or at least remaining about the same. That pattern did occur from early April to early June, a period when the availability of testing expanded significantly. However, that’s no longer the case. Since early June, the amount of testing being conducted has continued to reach new highs, yet the positivity rate has risen by a full percentage point."

1645,"In North Carolina, “you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying.” A viral Facebook post said ""you can be charged with a class H felony for wearing a mask and concealed carrying.” A North Carolina law does prohibit people from covering their faces in public. But that law is currently suspended. And, even if it weren't suspended, experts say it wouldn't affect concealed carry laws."
1646,"A “face mask exempt card” allows you to cite the ADA and not wear a mask. The Justice Department has debunked the claim. The Freedom to Breathe Agency isn’t a real federal agency. The Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability, does not specifically say anything about face masks. While it’s true that businesses are not allowed to ask customers about their disabilities, and there may be some exceptions to the law, governments have broad authority to issue health mandates during a pandemic."
1647,"A man in Argentina makes claims like “in the US, doctors are paid $13000 thousand to say they got sick from COVID-19 and $39000 to put that ventilator on, the artificial respirator.” The man repeats in the video conspiracy theories that have been denied by fact checkers from different countries of the world, including Colombia.

Furthermore, the pandemic is not over and there is no evidence that the coronavirus was created by humans as a ""biological weapon""."

1660,"Information circulating across social media platforms claims that Nigeria’s Federal Government has approved to disburse 30,000 to citizens as Covid-19 lockdown funds. The site lacks credibility for the claims it has made. Besides, requiring users to share its links and provide their bank details makes the site more suspicious and questionable. In sum, its methods make it look like a typical site for fraudsters. The claim is FALSE."
1661,"Two photos which show human throats have been shared hundreds of times in multiple Facebook posts warning about the seriousness of the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19. The photos have been shared in a misleading context; both images have circulated online before the COVID-19 pandemic; health experts have clarified that only a small percentage of COVID-19 patients are likely to develop the most severe symptoms."
1662,"A photo of a list of purported symptoms and treatments for the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, has been shared hundreds of times in multiple posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The claims are false; vaccine candidates go through three phases of clinical trials, are carefully monitored for adverse effects, and multiple doctors told AFP vaccines are safe."
1664,"A scientific study shows that cannabis is more effective at preventing and treating COVID-19 than hydroxychloroquine. The World Health Organization recognizes some therapeutic uses of cannabinoids. A recent scientific preprint reported that some cannabis strains might modulate the expression of ACE2, the viral receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in an in vitro study. However, the study does not present data on clinical outcomes in animals or humans (in vivo) during infection, nor does it test whether the cannabis extracts affect the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. It is thus impossible to know whether these specific cannabis strains could prevent or cure COVID-19 in people. The study also did not compare the effect of cannabis extracts with that of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19, so it does not provide any evidence for the claim that cannabis works better than hydroxychloroquine."

1681,"Alberto Fernández (President of Argentina), on the increase in cases in Buenos Aires: “They wanted to go running, go running. This is the consequence.” The President related the growth of coronavirus cases in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires to the relaxation of the quarantine for runners ordered by the Buenos Aires Government. However, according to the numbers of the City and the Province of Buenos Aires -where in the 40 municipalities of the AMBA it is not allowed to go running-, there is no correlation between flexibility and the increase in cases. Scientific studies enable the option of going for a run but, at the same time, recommend maintaining social distance. The same is maintained by the experts who advise Fernández."

Misbar has verified the news which turned out to be misleading.

The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) encourages workers to use face masks or cloth face coverings at work, in accordance with recommendations by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for reducing community transmission of COVID-19. At the moment, the use of face masks or coverings are not mandated by OSHA, but left to the employer’s discretion. Cloth face coverings are generally safe to use and do not lead to oxygen deficiency, since gas molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide are much smaller than the pores in fabric and pass through the covering easily. By blocking much larger respiratory droplets, which carry the virus, face masks and coverings help to protect others in the community and limit COVID-19 spread."

1736,"A text by C. S. Lewis, from 1942, talks about a “pandemic of fear”. It says the devil took many souls to hell because they became too attached to their earthly lives, through fear. The text was not written by C. S. Lewis, but by a Christian activist in 2020."

Bill Gates' first contribution to WHO regarding COVID-19 was made in February 2020, long before the pandemic was established. The second Bill Gates contribution was made in April 2020, after US President Donald Trump stopped funding for WHO. Regarding the designation of COVID-19 as a pandemic, this was done because the level of distribution and the number of victims had increased. In theory, COVID-19 also meets the criteria as a pandemic."

Newsom has broad authority under the California Emergency Services Act to issue health mandates during a pandemic. Two constitutional law experts said Newsom does, indeed, have the power to make face coverings mandatory under that act.

1755,A post suggests a conspiracy in the testing of a Chinese vaccine against COVID-19 in Brazil. It says: “China has 1 billion people and is going to test the vaccine in Sao Paulo?” The number of inhabitants is not a suitable metric for determining vaccine test sites.

We encounter fewer serious cases because we are now able to detect them earlier and treat them better, not because the virus has changed."
1790,"Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation building says “Center for Global Human Population Reduction” on its front. The image that circulates on social media is doctored.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has committed millions to the improvement of health outcomes in developing countries through vaccination campaigns, becoming a prominent target of the anti-vaccine groups. During the last decade, the foundation has also been involved in the development of health-related technology which, along with its active support of the research of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines during the outbreak, has led to the growth of conspiracy theories worldwide. The claim that Gates wants to use COVID-19 vaccines to track the population is unsupported. The vaccines used in the initiatives funded by the Gates Foundation in Africa and Asia were approved and safe."

The case in question was shared thousands of times in multiple social media accounts, every one of which used a completely different name for the 19 year old. Further, comercially available face masks have large enough pores that are more than enough wide to allow the flow of molecules like oxygen and carbon dioxide thus. Finaly, the idea that breathing in bacteria that we exhale can cause diseases like pleurisy is not backed by any scientific study or official scientific or medical institution. In fact, if an individual exhales those bacteria it means that they are already in his system thus the original argument does not make sense."

1816,"João Doria, governor of São Paulo, signed a contract with Sinovac to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 in August. Therefore, he knew all about the disease and is part of a Chinese conspiracy. Doria never said he signed a contract with Sinovac in 2019. What he actually said is that the partnership between Sinovac and the state government of São Paulo to test a COVID-19 vaccine, signed in June 2020, was only possible because a commercial representation was set up in Shanghai on August 2019."

1818,"“If we stopped testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any.” The swelling pandemic requires a more aggressive response than the White House has so far outlined. Halting testing wouldn’t eliminate COVID-19 cases. It would conceal them and could fuel an even greater crisis."

1836,"COVID-19 is disseminated intravascular coagulation, or pulmonary thrombosis, and ventilators and intensive care units (ICUs) were “never needed” in treating the disease because it can be fought with “antibiotics, anti-inflammatories and anticoagulants.” The disease is also caused by a bacteria that gets amplified by 5G technology. Thrombosis is only one possible effect of COVID. The drugs mentioned in the online posts were meant to address related infections in COVID-19 patients. The disease is viral and not bacterial in nature, and the claims about 5G having to do with the disease are unsupported."

This change in guidance occurred after several studies found that infected individuals can transmit COVID-19 even when not showing symptoms. Contrary to many viral claims, face masks do not cause oxygen deficiency or a toxic buildup of carbon dioxide. It is important to remember that cloth face masks, surgical masks, and even N95 respirators do not provide 100% protection from the novel coronavirus and therefore must be combined with other transmission control measures such as physical distancing and good hand hygiene."

1887,"João Doria, governor of São Paulo, signed a contract with Sinovac to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 in August. Therefore, he knew all about the disease and is part of a Chinese conspiracy. Doria never said he signed a contract with Sinovac in 2019.

He has rejected the quotes attributed to him in the viral posts."
1896,"A Twitter post titled “Sakam da kazam”: “July 15 Elections Will Be Used for Vaccinating Voters Through the Project of Bill and Melinda Gates” Such news has never been published on the portal ""Sakam da kazam"", and the photo that manipulates the public is a rough photomontage.

At least that is what Spanish researchers claim. On closer inspection, all the men in this study were older (60-plus on average) and we know nothing about their lifestyles or other conditions.

This was reported by CNBC as ""Coronavirus patients without symptoms aren’t driving the spread of the virus."" However, epidemiological experts have pointed out that this report is misleading, because patients without symptoms can and do transmit the infection, particularly in the case of pre-symptomatic individuals, who only develop symptoms later during infection and are not considered truly asymptomatic by the WHO's definition. A day later, Dr. Van Kerkhove clarified in a conference that her earlier remarks were based only on a small subset of studies and that it was a misunderstanding for her ""to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare."""

Despite presenting himself as a biologist, Bartomeu Payeras i Cifre is actually a Spanish painter, and there is no record of scientific publications by him in the scholarly databases of PubMed and Google Scholar, except for two publications on marine microbiology in the 1970s. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. There is no data demonstrating a causal link between 5G rollout in the world and the global COVID-19 pandemic. For example, 5G is not available in the hardest hit regions of France and Italy."

But she was not fired from there because she made a discovery that shook the research community, as she claims in the video. Apparently, there was a strange XMRV virus spreading, and the virus, Judy Mirovits claimed, could be treated with a type of HIV medication. But other researchers failed to recreate Judy Mikovits startling results, and two years later the journal withdrew the article after researchers found that Judy Mikovits' results were simply due to coincidence, and therefore her results were not to be trusted.

Citizens holding dual citizenships - Croatian and Bosnian and Herzegovina's have previously used a Croatian state issued ID for border crossings between the two countries, which became superseded by the decision from BiH's authorities in March 2020. Politicized articles claiming BiH is treating Bosnian Croats as third grade citizens, penalizing them upon entry into Bosnia and Herzegovina is inaccurate.

Experts say the WHO was slow to designate the coronavirus a pandemic and that the organization should have been more skeptical of information it received from China before it sent that tweet but that accusing the WHO of missing the pandemic altogether goes too far."

Contrary to what the articles suggest, the study was not conducted or funded by the NIH.

But the report did not recommend buying 16,000 ventilators, and did not indicate whether the state was at a fiscal position to purchase them. The state did not plan to increase its ventilator stockpile because it anticipated that in the event of a severe crisis, there would be shortage of trained staff to operate them and demand would outweigh any emergency stockpile. The report said the state had to balance the likely ventilator shortage with the need for adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses."

A runny nose, sputum, dry cough and pneumonia can be symptoms of COVID-19 however not everyone infected with the disease will have them. Disease expert Professor Collignon says temperatures around 26 to 27 degrees C won't kill the virus; however, UV light from the sun can be effective in drying out the virus. Understanding of how long COVID-19 survives on surfaces is limited, with the WHO referring to previous studies of other viruses to estimate a range of a few hours to a few days. Drinking warm water, avoiding iced drinks and gargling warm salt water are not treatments or preventions, but staying hydrated is important and gargling may relieve sore throats. The timeline for progression of COVID-19 symptoms is partly accurate but not everyone will experience all of these symptoms or in that order.
